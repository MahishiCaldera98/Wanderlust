                To 30km north-west of Dambulla, youâ€™ll find one of the most iconic monuments in Sri Lanka; Avukana
                Buddha Statue. This 12m height statue is a brilliant example for the Sri Lankan religious art at its
                classical best. Like many of the finest Sinhalese statues, the Aukana image succeeds in striking a
                delicate balance between realism and symbolism in its portrayal of Buddha, creating a figure at once
                recognizably human but also unquestionably Devine.

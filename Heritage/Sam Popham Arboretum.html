                The Popham Arboretum was a creation of British tea planter and keen dendrologist Sam Popham. Dismayed by
                the destruction of Sri Lankaâ€™s dry-zone forests, Popham established the arboretum in 1963 as an
                experiment in reforesting an area of the scrub jungle with minimum human interference, and it now
                preserves almost three hundred tree and plant species, including seven endemics, in a 36-acre stretch of
                woodland crisscrossed by a network of plants.

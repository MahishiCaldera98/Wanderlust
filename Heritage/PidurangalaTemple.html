                A couple of kilometres north of Sigiriya, another large rock outcrop is home to the Pidurangala Royal
                Cave Temple, offering superb view of Sigiriya Rock and an increasingly popular sunrise-viewing spot.
                According to tradition, the monastery here dates from the arrival of Kassapa, when the monks who were
                then living at Sigiriya were relocated to make room for the royal palace. The king provided a new
                dwelling and a temple at Pidurangala to compensate them.

                Despite the grand name, there’s not much to see apart from a long reclining Buddha under a large rock
                overhang. it’s upper half restored in brick. The statue is accompanied by figures of Vishnu and Saman
                and decorated with very faded murals.

                The reward for your effort of climbing to the top of the rock will be the best view of Sigiriya you can
                get short of chartering a balloon; the far more irregular and interestingly shaped northern side of the
                rock, which you don’t get to see when climbing up it

                According to the researches of Dr Mirando Obesekara, He identify the Sigiriya as a historical turning
                point of Ravana. Before 50 centuries Sigiriya named as Alakamandawa (Akasa Maligawa).
                The Indian ancient epic story “Ramayanaya” described the brother of Rawana (Kuwera/Waisrwana) is the
                owner of the Alakamandawa (Sigiriya)According to the Ravana watha Palm leaf book, Mayadanawa is the
                Architecture of the Sigiriya.
                He buid the Sigiriya according to instruction given by Vessamuni / Wishrawa Muni (Father of Ravana).
                Finally palace was dedicated for Ravana’s Brother King Kuwera(Waishrawana).
                After-wards the Ravana has banished the Kuwera & Got the Sigiriya under his Control.You can climb

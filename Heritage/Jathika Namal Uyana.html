                Arround 15km north of Dambulla is the remarkable Jathika Namal Uyana forest reserve. According to legend
                the forest was originally planted by king Devanampiya Tissa and later become a religious retreat –
                various monastic remains are dotted around the site. The reserve now protects Sri Lanka’s largest extant
                forest of indigenous ironwood, the country’s national tree, often planted close to Buddhist temples
                where its fragrant, four-petalled white flowers are a popular offering during puja. Also contained
                within the reserve is an impressive range of 550-million-year-old rose-quartz hill, the biggest such
                deposit in South Asia. Tradition claims that Mughal emperor Shah Hahan himself had stone imported from
                here for use in the construction of the Taj Mahal.

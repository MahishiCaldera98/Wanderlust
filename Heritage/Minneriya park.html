                Minneriya , an enormous irrigation reservoir built in 286AD by King Mahasena I of Anuradhapura. It is a
                sanctuary, best known for the ‘Gathering’, a seasonal congregation of wild elephants that attracts herds
                as big as 400 from all over the country to the shores of the Minneriya tank. Coming from all corners of
                the North Central Province, the ‘Gathering’ of elephants showcase Sri Lanka’s harmonious relationship
                with nature in all its glory. Recognised the world over as one of the greatest wildlife spectacles on
                Earth.

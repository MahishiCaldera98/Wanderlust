                Dambulla Royal Cave Temple is a World Heritage Site (since 1991) in Sri Lanka. It’s located in the heart
                of Dambulla city, And a ten to fifteen minute walk up to the temple from the entrance. There are five
                cave temples and it’s best to visit the caves in reverse order, starting at the end (cave 5) and walked
                backwards. This way you get to see the caves in gradually increasing degree of magnificence.

                The cave temples date back to the days of King Vattagamini Abhaya (also known as King Valagamba; reigned
                103 BC and 89 – 77 BC). History says he lost his throne to Tamil invaders from India just months after
                becoming the king. Then he hides in these caves for nearly 14 years preparing to reclaim the throne.
                Soon after reclaiming the throne, temples were constructed as a gratitude for the shelter the rock had
                offered him.

                Kaludiya Pokuna is an archaeological forest site with many archaeological remains scattered around the
                area. The name “Kaludiya Pokuna” (“Black Water Pond”) is given because of a pond in the vicinity which
                had dark water during ancient times. The forest has many species of birds, butterflies, reptiles and
                mammals.
